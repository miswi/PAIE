Granted , newspapers typically run stories with sensational headlines because they want to sell lots of newspapers and true journalistic integrity in this age of rampant deception is all but ancient history . And of course , an army of government shills and trolls have thoroughly infiltrated if not saturated both mainstream as well as alternative internet and social media with the expressed purpose of muddying the waters to intentionally misinform , <t> deceive </t> and confuse the public , making them highly susceptible to nefarious manipulation by fear porn propaganda . Under the chronic duress of hypervigilance and paranoia , both the sheeple and the so - called “ awakened ” can become more easily controlled , and certainly the trusting diehards will automatically be predisposed to seek protection and security in the face of real or perceived rising dangers from their Big Brother government , the very same perpetrator responsible for their mass brainwashing , mind control and pervasive harm . That said when bits and pieces of information are leaked and astute observers who are aware of historical patterns of deceptive US government behavior repeated ad nauseam by our enslavers , a clear picture of connected dots emerges of what may actually be unfolding .

He has also lambasted the United States for refusing to immediately hand over Fethullah Gulen , the Pennsylvania - based Muslim cleric whom Ankara accuses of being behind the coup attempt . The growing rift with the West , as well as fears over Syria and economic concerns , spurred Mr Erdogan to seek to restore relations with Moscow that were <t> wrecked </t> last November when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet over the Syrian border . The sudden rapprochement between Turkey and Russia unnerved some officials in the EU and Nato , who fear the two autocratic and powerful leaders could cause trouble for the West on issues including Syria and refugees . As Turkish diplomats and military and intelligence officials held talks in Moscow yesterday , foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said his compatriots had lost confidence in the EU because it had “ failed a test ” over the coup .

Indeed , Trump should n’t be dismissed as a mere apostate in his view of America ’s role in the world ; against the backdrop of all 239 years of America ’s existence , he represents more a reversion to the American norm . Trump , in condemning one of the worst instances of American overreach in U.S. history , the Iraq invasion , declared in his speech : “ The world must know we do not go abroad in search of enemies . ” The line was an allusion to the famous <t> injunction </t> of John Quincy Adams in 1821 that America " does not go in search of monsters to destroy . She is the well - wisher to the freedom and independence of all . She is the champion and vindicator only of her own . ” Adams went on to warn , somewhat presciently , America should know that “ once enlisting under other banners than her own , were they even the banners of foreign independence , she would involve herself , beyond the power of extrication , in all the wars of interest and intrigue , of individual avarice , envy , and ambition , which assume the colors and usurp the standard of freedom .

Mr. Trump ’s demolition contractor hired about 200 unauthorized Polish laborers , paying them as little as $ 4 an hour to work 12 hours a day , seven days a week . The case ended up in federal court after some workers were shortchanged even these <t> wages </t> . Mr. Trump protested that he knew nothing about the use of unauthorized workers — even though workers testified that they saw him visiting the site and some witnesses said that Mr. Trump and the executive he assigned to oversee the demolition were well aware of what was going on . In 1991 , a federal judge , Charles E. Stewart Jr. , ruled that despite Mr. Trump ’s denials , there was “ strong evidence ” that he and his subordinates and his contractor had conspired to hire the Polish workers and deprive them of employment benefits .

Sent: Indeed , a kind of American exceptionalism does seem to underpin much opportunity - focused political rhetoric . ” This preference for insider politics ( rather than mass movements involving direct action ) and limited , means - tested social programs speaks to a broader truth about modern liberalism : it functions in a way that not only does n’t challenge the basic tenets of American exceptionalism , it often reinforces them . Whether vindicating war and <t> torture </t> and civil liberties violations , talking past the War on Drugs and the carceral state , or exhibiting coolness toward the type of popular protest seen during of Occupy Wall Street , with its direct attacks on a sort of American Sonderweg , establishment Democrats are adept at using a more “ realistic ” brand of Americentrism to consolidate power and anchor the party in the status quo . Now the 2016 Democratic Primary has seen progressive ideas including universal health care , tuition - free college , and a living minimum wage , all hallmarks of large swaths of the rest of the developed world , delegitimized through some mutation of liberal exceptionalist thinking . These broadminded reforms are apparently off limits , not because they are not good ideas ( though opponents make that appraisal too ) , but because somehow their unachievability is exceptional to the United States .

He confessed that Keynesian “ stabilization policy ” had been a failure .

This is the most educated generation in American history by both total degrees and share of college graduates .

One study from the San Francisco Federal Reserve found that since 2009 , wages for recent college graduates have grown 60 percent more slowly than those of the general population .

Sent: There are two major reasons that so many questions remain about the nature of Manafort ’s work for Yanukovych and the Party of Regions . The first is simple : Manafort has refused to describe it . Much of what is known emerged only after Yanukovych <t> fled </t> Ukraine in 2014 , ousted by a popular revolution , and volunteer divers retrieved thousands of internal government documents that had been hastily thrown into a lake at his presidential retreat . Additional paperwork was found tossed inside a Ukrainian prosecutor ’s sauna . The documents were dried and assembled by local journalists ; some offer details on Manafort ’s role in Yanukovych ’s reign , helping to coordinate a U.S. law firm ’s favorable inquiry into Yanukovych ’s arrest of a political opposition leader .

Sent: The FBI has uncovered evidence that foreign hackers penetrated two state election databases in recent weeks , prompting the bureau to warn election officials across the country to take new steps to enhance the security of their computer systems , according to federal and state law enforcement officials . The FBI warning , contained in a “ flash ” alert from the FBI ’s Cyber Division , a copy of which was obtained by Yahoo News , comes amid heightened concerns among U.S. intelligence officials about the possibility of cyberintrusions , potentially by Russian state - sponsored hackers , aimed at disrupting the November elections . Those concerns prompted Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to <t> convene </t> a conference call with state election officials on Aug. 15 , in which he offered his department ’s help to make state voting systems more secure , including providing federal cybersecurity experts to scan for vulnerabilities , according to a “ readout ” of the call released by the department . Johnson emphasized in the call that Homeland Security was not aware of “ specific or credible cybersecurity threats ” to the election , officials said . But three days after that call , the FBI Cyber Division issued a potentially more disturbing warning , titled “ Targeting Activity Against State Board of Election Systems . ” The alert , labeled as restricted for “ NEED TO KNOW recipients , ” disclosed that the bureau was investigating cyberintrusions against two state election websites this summer

In 2011 , a major study by University of California , Berkeley , political scientist M.

That was approximately a third of the rate for the non - Muslim world and less than the average rate in Europe .

The one common mechanical process in almost every aspect of American politics is the two - party system : an extra - constitutional artifice that long ago <t> hijacked </t> government . And it is through those double swinging doors that we have stumbled into our current political purgatory . This bi - polar orgy of villainy signifies that America 's two - party system itself is badly broken ; indeed , odds are that such a scenario would not have emerged if there were additional healthy political parties .

Sent: Asking malapportioned lawmakers to decide whether to continue malapportionment is a bit like polling billionaires on whether their fortunes should be taxed . Indeed , Thomas ’ opinion seems to suggest that billionaires should have an outsized voice in the nation ’s political disputes . The justice criticizes the one person / one vote doctrine because he believes that it is “ driven by the belief that there is a single , correct answer to the question of how much voting strength an individual citizen should have . ” Such an assertion , Thomas claims , “ overlook[s ] that , to control factions that would <t> legislate </t> against the common good , individual voting strength must sometimes yield to counter majoritarian checks . ” As a sign of what sort of factions Thomas finds needing of control , and which “ counter majoritarian checks ” he deems necessary , Thomas offers a theory of the Constitution that closely resembles a theory a libertarian group funded by the billionaire Koch brothers tried to teach to school children . “ Of particular concern for the Framers was the majority of people violating the property rights of the minority , ” Thomas writes .

A Russian news site , Sputnik News , reported that the strange 64-character codes could have been part of a “ dead man ’s switch ” which would indicate that Snowden had been <t> captured </t> or killed . The dead man ’s switch is “ a message set up to be automatically sent if the holder of an account does not perform a regular check - in . The whistleblower has acknowledged that he has distributed encrypted files to journalists and associates that have not yet been released , so in Snowden ’s case , the dead man ’s switch could be an encryption key for those files . ” Therefore , when the code was released for a brief moment on Snowden ’s Twitter account , his followers quickly went into internet sleuth mode and attempted to decipher the meaning of the message .

Sent: Advertisement Continue reading the main story In many respects , Mrs. Clinton ’s campaign against Mr. Trump has flipped the traditional contours of defense politics , offering voters a Democrat with more hawkish instincts and deeper ties to the national security establishment , and a Republican who has broadly rejected military intervention and has been spurned by many defense leaders in his own party . Mrs. Clinton is by far the more conventionally experienced and credentialed candidate , and in some respects is more hawkish : She has called for the creation of a no - fly zone in Syria , as well as more airstrikes there , and has <t> urged </t> closer collaboration with Silicon Valley to expand the United States ’ surveillance capabilities , alarming some civil liberties advocates . In Mr. Trump , she confronts a candidate who has been abandoned by most of his party ’s national security elite , who is still unable to produce a detailed set of proposals for stopping terrorism , and whose essential political brand — disruption — does not always comfort voters seeking strength in moments of crisis and terror . Tommy Vietor , a former national security spokesman for Mr. Obama , said that if Democrats were conventionally cast as the “ mommy party ” and Republicans as the “ daddy party ” in American politics , then “ Trump is the crazy uncle and Hillary Clinton is the only person you trust to watch your family for a week .

Unsurprisingly , Clinton acquiesced and chose one of the officials <t> recommended </t> by Soros — Miroslav Lajcak . This is standard operating procedure for Soros . Anyone familiar with the history of the Soros Open Society Foundations in Eastern Europe and around the world since the late 1980s , will know that his supposedly philanthropic “ democracy - building ” projects in Poland , Russia , or Ukraine in the 1990s allowed Soros the businessman to literally plunder the former communist countries wealth , according to the New Eastern Outlook .

( Similar charges have long been made against populists ; in 1935 , the NEW REPUBLIC rhetorically asked Huey Long , “ Upon what statistics of economic studies do you base your conclusions ? ” ) While it was true that the details ( and costs ) of Sanders ’s proposals often did n’t add up , it was certainly conceivable that the United States could enact them — after all , Canada and several European countries have “ Medicare for all . ” What made them seem unrealistic was their challenge to the market liberal consensus on fiscal restraint and redistribution . Unlike Trump , Sanders never contended , as his liberal critics <t> suggested </t> , that if he were elected president , he could enact the changes he advocated . “ If we are going to transform America , ” he said last November in Las Vegas , “ we need a political revolution . Millions of people have to stand up and get involved in the political process in a way we have not in many , many years . ”

" As several opinion polls show , a majority of Americans do not like her , in large part because she is seen as the latest manifestation of the ‘ Clinton Machine , ’ " he acknowledged , referring to the entrenched connections and loyalists in the US establishment . Sanders has routinely criticized Clinton for her connections to the large financial institutions on Wall Street and hefty <t> payments </t> and donations she received from them . President Putin was also accurate in his observation because the very structure of the US political system was strongly weighted against change , renewal and reform by electing new people with different ideas to the two chambers of Congress , Schirach maintained . " The real problem in American politics is that the system at the congressional level — mostly in the House of Representatives , but also in Senate elections — strongly favors incumbents , " he stated .

He has also lambasted the United States for refusing to immediately hand over Fethullah Gulen , the Pennsylvania - based Muslim cleric whom Ankara accuses of being behind the coup attempt . The growing rift with the West , as well as fears over Syria and economic concerns , spurred Mr Erdogan to seek to restore relations with Moscow that were wrecked last November when Turkey <t> shot </t> down a Russian fighter jet over the Syrian border . The sudden rapprochement between Turkey and Russia unnerved some officials in the EU and Nato , who fear the two autocratic and powerful leaders could cause trouble for the West on issues including Syria and refugees .

Sent: But for the most part , we 've lost these other definitions of democracy . That 's a real problem , because in this country , certainly , the strength of our democracy has always had more to do with the strength of popular movements of workers and oppressed groups than whichever windbags were elected to Congress or the White House . One of the main reasons we have so little democracy today , even relative to the recent past , is that protest movements are weak , having been greatly hurt in turn by recent assaults on democratic rights : Occupy encampments ruthlessly evicted ( mostly by Democratic Party mayors , by the way ) , Verizon strikers barred from picketing in important locations , laws that make <t> boycotts </t> in solidarity with Palestine illegal . That means that the fight against Donald Trump and all he stands for is n't about defending democracy so much as creating it . For one thing , we need to assert not just our right to vote , but our right to vote for someone other than the oligarchy - approved Hillary Clinton instead of an independent left - wing alternative like the Green Party 's Jill Stein .

From his talk of " rigged elections " to his suggestion that we need Russia to hack Clinton ’s emails if the Justice Department wo n’t <t> indict </t> her , Trump ’s message is clear : Clinton is so corrupt , and the system that favors her is so broken , that our ordinary democratic and legal processes are n’t equipped to handle it .

That 's a real problem , because in this country , certainly , the strength of our democracy has always had more to do with the strength of popular movements of workers and oppressed groups than whichever windbags were elected to Congress or the White House . One of the main reasons we have so little democracy today , even relative to the recent past , is that protest movements are weak , having been greatly hurt in turn by recent assaults on democratic rights : Occupy encampments ruthlessly evicted ( mostly by Democratic Party mayors , by the way ) , Verizon strikers barred from picketing in important locations , laws that make <t> boycotts </t> in solidarity with Palestine illegal . That means that the fight against Donald Trump and all he stands for is n't about defending democracy so much as creating it . For one thing , we need to assert not just our right to vote , but our right to vote for someone other than the oligarchy - approved Hillary Clinton instead of an independent left - wing alternative like the Green Party 's Jill Stein .

In a surprise appearance , Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus , who in private expressed fury over some of Trump 's actions earlier this month , introduced the candidate at a campaign event in Erie , Pennsylvania , and the two hugged onstage . " We ’re so honored to be working with Donald Trump and the campaign , " Priebus told thousands of Trump supporters .

Unwinding this system today is almost unthinkable : American power overlays every region of the planet , and it supplies the control rods that restrain belligerents and arms races from East Asia to Latin America ( if not always successfully , as we ’ve seen in the Mideast and Afghanistan ) . Nor does Trump appear to be going so far as to say he wants to <t> withdraw </t> from the global system—“To all our friends and allies , I say America is going to be strong again .

The newspaper noted that the Florida Senate race is one of the most crucial contests of the election season that is surprisingly close due to the changing attitudes of Cuban - Americans voters . " The changing Latino electorate is the key factor , with Cuban - Americans , who once swung reliably Republican , increasingly up for grabs , particularly younger voters who are more socially liberal than their parents and less dogmatic about the Cuban embargo , " the editors argued .

Sent: Black people are nearly six times as likely to be locked up as their white peers , with only about 61 to 80 percent of that overrepresentation explained by higher crime rates in black communities . The racial disparity is one of the major explanations for black Americans ’ distrust of the criminal justice system . It is , in other words , one reason that people in these communities may feel the need to take the law into their own hands — sometimes leading to more <t> violent </t> crime . But were the racially disparate results that have led to this distrust deliberate — the " new Jim Crow , " to use a term popularized by Michelle Alexander ’s book of the same name ? Latzer ’s history suggests they were n’t , since policymakers — including black leaders — were reacting to a real crime wave .

Mr. Trump ’s florid reputation , past support for abortion rights and harsh language — including a vulgarity he used last week about Mr. Cruz — could alienate social conservatives and establishment Republicans in the state , according to Bush advisers . While Mr. Bush has <t> assailed </t> Mr. Trump in the past and described him as all but unqualified for the presidency , the Saturday debate was his most forceful performance of the race . The debate was also critical for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida after his disastrous turn in a face - off last weekend in New Hampshire , where Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey savaged him as scripted and callow after Mr. Rubio kept repeating the same stock attack on President Obama .

Sent: From the start the DLC maintained a strong neo - conservative agenda , especially in foreign policy . Its selection of Bill Clinton as chairman in 1990 helped cement its acceptance with the general public but the split within the party grew even deeper . These " New Democrats " sold themselves as centrist reformers but behaved more like merchant bankers and , within a few years , ushered in a raft of privatizations , Wall Street giveaways , tough - on - crime laws , and deregulated trade rules that would <t> rob </t> the middle class and set a course toward financial ruin . The New Democrats were quickly swapping tried and true Democratic Party values for tried and true Republican virtues , and within no time had banished the real " left " in anything but name from the political process . Prior to the 1990s , old Democrats were careful to reconcile their rank and file with the " limousine liberals " who financed candidates and funded campaigns , but according to the author of Reinventing Democrats , Kenneth Baer , the DLC was now brazenly selling itself as an " elite organization [ within the party ] funded by elite - corporate and private - donors .
