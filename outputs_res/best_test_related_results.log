Mr al - Zoubi said in an interview , “ All of the oil was delivered to a company that belongs to the son of Recep [ Tayyip ] Erdogan . This is why Turkey became anxious when Russia began delivering airstrikes against the IS infrastructure and destroyed more than 500 trucks with oil already .

Two months after the FDIC ’s warning letter to Jamie Dimon , in June ( 2016 ) , this report says , he cryptically “ sounded a warning ” that the United States sub - prime auto loan bubble was nearing collapse and stated that “ someone is going to get hurt ” .

Sent: Assad ’s recent military advances around Aleppo – Syria ’s second city – have largely been enabled by the ferocity of Russian airstrikes against opposition positions . There is scepticism that the ceasefire will hold due to the difficulties in marking out what territory is covered , and the way in which some opposition groups are interwoven with al - Nusra Front . The Syrian government stressed the importance of sealing the borders , halting foreign support to armed groups and “ preventing these organisations from strengthening their capabilities or changing their positions ” , in order to avoid <t> wrecking </t> the agreement . Assad believes Turkey has acted as a supply line for foreign fighters supporting both the “ moderate ” opposition and Isis . Turkey has welcomed the ceasefire plan , but is under pressure from the UN to allow entry to tens of thousands more refugees massed on the Syrian border .

Among those were the 2008 judgment from the appeals court , led by Garland , that punched a hole in the Bush administration ’s detention of so - called “ enemy combatants ” in Guantánamo Bay without any oversight from the civilian courts .

Sent: And never mind that Trump spent the first portion of the debate apologizing for a video leaked over the weekend in which he grotesquely bragged about his ability to commit sexual assault because he 's a " star . " Diving deeply into the gutter , Trump tried to turn the video into a bizarre bank shot attack on Clinton by bringing to the debate women who claim former President Bill Clinton sexually abused them . Trump , who himself faced a <t> rape </t> allegation from ex - wife Ivana Trump and now faces one from a woman who was 13-years old at the time the alleged act occurred ( Trump has repeatedly denied the allegations ) argues that Hillary Clinton is worse than he is because she attempted to smear and intimidate Bill Clinton 's accusers , though the evidence for that smearing and intimidation is thin to nonexistent . Trump also spent the debate wandering around the stage and regularly crowding Clinton 's space and glowering over her shoulder like a stalker . When asked by a Muslim - American in the audience how he would deal with " Islamophobia , " Trump repeated the debunked claim that witnesses saw " bombs all over the apartment " of the San Bernardino terrorists and failed to report it .

Both as Secretary of State and since her departure in 2013 , Clinton has pressed to escalate the “ regime change ” war in Syria , seeking a “ no - fly zone ” that would require the U.S. military to destroy the Syrian government ’s air force and air defenses , apparently without regard to the risk that the U.S. intervention could pave the way for Al Qaeda ’s Nusra Front and/or the Islamic State to march into Damascus . Though the Syrian “ regime change ” strategy that Clinton has advocated has failed to <t> oust </t> President Bashar al - Assad , it has transformed another reasonably functional Mideast state into a bloody killing field and driven millions of refugees into what is now a destabilized Europe . In 2014 , Clinton also has embraced the neocon - backed coup in Ukraine that has touched off a new and costly Cold War with Russia . Again showing her “ tough - gal ” side , Clinton likened Russia ’s President Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler .

" Therefore we would like Assad also to respond to this , " he said , adding that the Syrian leader 's stance " is not in accord with the diplomatic efforts that Russia is making . " At their meeting in Munich , the 17-nation group backing Syria 's peace process agreed to work for a ceasefire , the lifting of <t> starvation </t> sieges and the resumption of talks . In an interview with AFP last week , Assad defiantly pledged to retake the whole of the country , speaking before the plan for a nationwide " cessation of hostilities " in Syria was announced . Asked to comment to journalists on the unusually outspoken criticism of Assad , Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday said President Vladimir Putin backed the Syrian peace process but stressed that the ceasefire had not yet been implemented .

We should look carefully at the track record of this ancient technology before we invest what some estimates <t> suggest </t> could be $ 25 billion in construction costs for a 2,000-mile - long wall , plus millions more in annual maintenance . One of the earliest examples of a large - scale barrier wall was constructed by the rulers of the city of Ur , in what is now southern Iraq , at the end of the third millennium B.C. The kings of Ur faced a considerable challenge along their northwestern border from a semi - nomadic people known as the Amorites .

" They have <t> executed </t> dozens of fighters on charges of giving information to the coalition or putting ( GPS ) chips in order for the aircraft to strike at a specific area , " said Abdurrahman , referring to ISIS in Syria . The militants have responded with methods of their own for rooting out spies , said the informant . For example , they have fed false information to a suspect member about the movements of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al - Baghdadi , and if an airstrike follows on the alleged location , they know the suspect is a spy , he said .

Sent: Petraeus in pushing Obama into a major escalation of the Afghan War , a counter - insurgency “ surge ” that sent another 1,000 American troops to their deaths – and many more Afghans – but has since been abandoned as a failure . In 2011 , Clinton joined with “ liberal interventionists ” in again pushing Obama into a “ regime change ” war in Libya that led to the overthrow and torture - <t> murder </t> of Muammar Gaddafi – which she gleefully welcomed with the quip , “ We came , we saw , he died ” – but has since turned the once relatively prosperous North African country into a failed state with the Islamic State gaining another foothold . Both as Secretary of State and since her departure in 2013 , Clinton has pressed to escalate the “ regime change ” war in Syria , seeking a “ no - fly zone ” that would require the U.S. military to destroy the Syrian government ’s air force and air defenses , apparently without regard to the risk that the U.S. intervention could pave the way for Al Qaeda ’s Nusra Front and/or the Islamic State to march into Damascus . Though the Syrian “ regime change ” strategy that Clinton has advocated has failed to oust President Bashar al - Assad , it has transformed another reasonably functional Mideast state into a bloody killing field and driven millions of refugees into what is now a destabilized Europe .

Instead , the Post retained its neocon editorial page editor Fred Hiatt and nearly all of its pro - war columnists and the Times even promoted liberal interventionist Bill Keller to the top job of executive editor after it became clear that he had been snookered about Iraq ’s WMD . Similar patterns were followed across the board , from The New Yorker on the Left to The Wall Street Journal on the Right .

The ‘ Vacuum ’ Clinton described a “ vacuum ” that could result if Americans <t> withdraw </t> overseas like America did during Clinton ’s State Department term , when the U.S. pulled out of Iraq and gave rise to ISIS . Trump has criticized the decision to announce the firm date when U.S. forces would leave . “ We are not a country that cowers behind walls , ” Clinton said .

Sent: But the weaker regulations also make it potentially easier for arms smugglers and human rights abusers to get their hands on US arms . For example , 36 US allies — from Argentina and Bulgaria to Romania and Turkey — will no longer need licenses from the State Department to import weapons and weapons parts from the United States . This will make it far easier for <t> smuggling </t> networks to set up front companies in such countries and get US arms and arms components that they can then pass on to third parties like Iran or China . Already a common practice , it will only increase under the new regulations . The degree to which the Obama administration has been willing to bend over backward to help weapons exporters was underscored at a 2013 hearing on those administration export “ reforms . ” Tom Kelly , then the deputy assistant secretary of the State Department ’s Bureau of Political - Military Affairs , caught the spirit of the era when asked whether the administration was doing enough to promote American arms exports .

Sent: Paying for legal and PR expenses — if it happened — suggests the possibility that Clinton sought to control her aides and others involved in the email scandal during interviews with Congress and law enforcement . In October , a website called Complete Colorado published an invoice from Platte River Networks , the Denver - based company that Clinton hired after leaving office to manage her server . The company maintained the server at a New Jersey data center until the FBI <t> seized </t> it last summer . The invoice indicated that Platte River Networks was billing Clinton for legal and public relations services related to its work during the email scandal fallout . Andy Boian , the CEO of dovetail solutions , the company that handles PR for Platte River , has declined comment to TheDC .

Sent: But the weaker regulations also make it potentially easier for arms smugglers and human rights abusers to get their hands on US arms . For example , 36 US allies — from Argentina and Bulgaria to Romania and Turkey — will no longer need licenses from the State Department to import weapons and weapons parts from the United States . This will make it far easier for <t> smuggling </t> networks to set up front companies in such countries and get US arms and arms components that they can then pass on to third parties like Iran or China . Already a common practice , it will only increase under the new regulations . The degree to which the Obama administration has been willing to bend over backward to help weapons exporters was underscored at a 2013 hearing on those administration export “ reforms . ” Tom Kelly , then the deputy assistant secretary of the State Department ’s Bureau of Political - Military Affairs , caught the spirit of the era when asked whether the administration was doing enough to promote American arms exports .

Both as Secretary of State and since her departure in 2013 , Clinton has pressed to escalate the “ regime change ” war in Syria , seeking a “ no - fly zone ” that would require the U.S. military to destroy the Syrian government ’s air force and air defenses , apparently without regard to the risk that the U.S. intervention could pave the way for Al Qaeda ’s Nusra Front and/or the Islamic State to march into Damascus . Though the Syrian “ regime change ” strategy that Clinton has advocated has failed to <t> oust </t> President Bashar al - Assad , it has transformed another reasonably functional Mideast state into a bloody killing field and driven millions of refugees into what is now a destabilized Europe . In 2014 , Clinton also has embraced the neocon - backed coup in Ukraine that has touched off a new and costly Cold War with Russia . Again showing her “ tough - gal ” side , Clinton likened Russia ’s President Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler .

Sent: Those UN sanctions were ultimately adopted in June 2010 , and President Barack Obama declared them the toughest ever enacted on Tehran . But that assessment was soon outstripped by unilateral sanctions enacted by the U.S. Congress , which went beyond the U.N. punishment , and that Obama ultimately signed into law . Top Iranian officials have admitted that sanctions relief included in the Iran deal drove them to begin talks , backing up Clinton 's claim that her push to <t> enact </t> sanctions brought Tehran to the nuclear negotiations . But while Clinton 's role in pushing foreign countries to adopt the tough UN sanctions is clear , it 's also evident U.S. lawmakers pushed for tough sanctions as well -- indeed , tougher sanctions than Clinton was lobbying for abroad . Verdict : Mostly true .

I argued that we — political and media elites — <t> demand </t> that candidates put themselves through a somewhat artificial ritual of proving their foreign policy credentials , that this ritual is more about reassuring establishment figures than about actual foreign policy , and we should n't write Sanders off on foreign policy purely because his political incentives do not line up with conducting this ritual as usual . On Thursday , in his MSNBC debate with Hillary Clinton , Sanders went ahead and put my theory to the ultimate make - or - break test , giving a cringe - a - minute performance on foreign policy that was near - universally panned .

Sent: Efforts to reach Mr. Assange for comment were unsuccessful , and a Clinton campaign spokesman did not respond to an inquiry . In November 2010 , when WikiLeaks and its news media partners began publishing the cables , Mrs. Clinton strongly condemned it . “ In addition to endangering particular individuals , disclosures like these <t> tear </t> at the fabric of the proper function of responsible government , ” she said then . Mr. Assange ’s remarks last month received only scattered attention , in part because in the interview Mr. Peston appeared to mistakenly assume that WikiLeaks had obtained still - undisclosed emails from the private server Mrs. Clinton had used while secretary of state and kept cutting Mr. Assange off to ask about it . But it now seems clearer that Mr. Assange was trying to talk about the Democratic National Committee emails .

His attendance at the RT gala , before which he also gave a talk on world affairs , appeared to inaugurate a relationship with the network — presumably a paid one , though neither Flynn nor RT answered queries on the subject .

In fact , Clinton ’s campaign is engaged in precisely the kind of money - driven secrecy and subversion that Democrats have long insisted were <t> wrecking </t> American politics . According to the Daily Beast , a pro - Clinton SuperPAC called “ Correct the Record ” has spent $ 1 million “ pushing back against ” Bernie Sanders supporters on social media , “ addressing ” thousands of people on Facebook , Twitter , Reddit , and Instagram . What this amounts to in practice is creating hundreds of fake accounts , which then place campaign propaganda all over the web as if it came from ordinary supporters .

Sent: Something of a trade contest has emerged between the United States ’ TPP initiative versus China ’s countervailing RCEP initiative . The TPP represents an important component of America ’s ‘ Asian pivot ’ as it aims to tie up key economic partners under rules which are favourable to the United States . Certainly , the United States ’ <t> hijacking </t> of the TPP process , from initially being outside the negotiations to taking on a leadership role , suggests that there is a sense for the United States to use its power advantage before it is rivalled by China and others ( possibly India , for example ) . China ’s motivation for the RCEP is similarly about maximising its power . However , whereas the United States appears motivated because of its declining power , China ’s motivation clearly stems from its rising power .

But Trump curiously refuses to acknowledge that this love originates with Russian criminals , and he still has n't explained his pro - Kremlin sympathies . He has n't explained why he repeatedly calls a kleptocrat a " stronger leader " than President Obama , other than poll numbers ; why he claims Russia had not <t> invaded </t> Ukraine or annexed Crimea ; why he has n't denounced its intimidation of the Baltic states , or has n't pledged his allegiance to NATO allies against Russian aggression ; why he rejected Mike Pence 's call for Putin 's provocation to be " met with American strength " ; and why he calls for Russians to commit more cyber - espionage . Nor has he acknowledged how he was bankrolled by Russian investors , when American banks closed the spigot after his multiple bankruptcies ; and how his three advisors - Paul Manafort , Carter Page , and Lt . Gen. Michael Flynn - have connections to Russian oligarchs . The Clinton transcripts are interesting reading , but little else : She seems wobbly on fracking , trade and Keystone , but she largely comes across as a smart and pragmatic politician .

Sent: Trump and VP nominee Mike Pence have asked whether Clinton ’s emails led to the execution of a former U.S. defector from Iran . This is among the stupidest claims made so far in this campaign . A check of newspaper clips shows that the saga of Shahram Amiri , the <t> executed </t> scientist , was well - covered by the media in 2009 and 2010 . Iranian officials could have learned everything they needed to know about Amiri ’s defection from reading The Washington Post — and there was little to be learned from the cryptic messages in Clinton ’s emails . It seemed like such a sweet story — Donald Trump sending his personal plane down to Camp Lejeune , N.C. , when 200 Marines were stranded after fighting in the 1991 Persian Gulf War .

Amid calls for reform to redistribute wealth in the United States to the middle and working classes , criticism has mounted , stereotyping such reforms as " handouts , " " free stuff " or " socialist .

Sent: Those gaps have confounded the inspectors ’ attempts to verify whether or not Syria has fully abandoned its chemical weapons program , fueling suspicions by the United States and other Western powers that the government may be seeking to retain a limited capacity to use the nerve agents and other lethal toxins against the rebels working to unseat Syrian President Bashar al - Assad . In a confidential two - page summary of the report , OPCW Director - General Ahmet Uzumcu writes that the majority of 122 samples taken at “ multiple locations ” in Syria “ indicate potentially undeclared chemical weapons - related activities . ” Many of Syria ’s explanations for the presence of undeclared agents , he added , “ are not scientifically or technically plausible , and … the presence of several undeclared chemical warfare agents is still to be clarified . ” The incomplete and sometimes <t> misleading </t> assertions by the Assad government have shaped the often rocky relationship between foreign inspectors and their Syrian counterparts , bedeviling international efforts to determine whether or not Damascus has abided by its obligation to destroy its chemical weapons . Assad promised to eliminate his stores in 2013 to avert promised U.S. airstrikes against regime targets . The findings of the OPCW ’s Declarations Assessment Team report — which is marked “ highly protected ” — contrast sharply with Assad ’s public insistence that Syria ’s chemical weapons have been largely eliminated .

It ’s a monster business ( in every sense of the word ) and certainly has far more dangerous consequences than licensing a Hollywood blockbuster or selling another Boeing airliner . Historically , there have been rare occasions of public protest against unbridled arms <t> trafficking </t> , as with the backlash against “ the merchants of death ” after World War I , or the controversy over who armed Saddam Hussein that followed the 1991 Persian Gulf War . Even now , small numbers of congressional representatives , including John Conyers , Chris Murphy , and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul , continue to try to halt the sale of cluster munitions , bombs , and missiles to Saudi Arabia .

Bush administration was greeted among his party not as an indictment of its fanatical tax-­cutting , deregulatory agenda and failed effort to privatize Social Security , but as evidence that Bush was not conservative enough . During the Obama administration , a spate of right - wing primary challenges <t> eradicated </t> what was left of the party ’s vestigial moderate wing and cowed its remaining mainstream members into submission . That the contemporary Republican Party shares a name with the Republican Party of the 1970s — or even of the ’ 80s or ’ 90s — has created massive confusion over just how distinct its worldview is . According to one measure of ideology used widely by political scientists , the most conservative Republican in the House 25 years ago , when the House attacked a Republican president for the heresy of increasing taxes , would be among the most liberal House Republicans today .

Over 80,000 people have been arrested , <t> sacked </t> or suspended , including soldiers , judges , teachers , policemen , businessmen and even football officials . Nearly 100 journalists have been detained and more than a hundred media outlets shut down ; ordinary criminals have been set free to make room for political cases .

We hear a lot about how smart Hillary Clinton is , but it ’s important to point out that she has been caught in plenty of lies , too . Blaming the fact that we know about these <t> lies </t> on Russia is yet another sign of flawed thinking . It ’s a classic example of a “ red herring , ” where you avoid dealing with an issue by creating a distraction . Since Clinton had to deal with a lot of false accusations , she used those unwarranted attacks to avoid talking about any of the valid concerns the public had .

This will make it far easier for <t> smuggling </t> networks to set up front companies in such countries and get US arms and arms components that they can then pass on to third parties like Iran or China . Already a common practice , it will only increase under the new regulations .

She said she assumed Russia would veto any attempt by the United Nations Security Council to bring those responsible to <t> trial </t> , so Australia would consider other options . “ There can be a Lockerbie - style prosecution , a tribunal that ’s set up by the international community , or there can be domestic prosecutions in , say , the Netherlands , ” she said . “ As long as they had the powers of extradition and the like , a prosecution could be mounted successfully in a domestic jurisdiction , but that would cover the interests of the 298 victims aboard that flight . ”

That first installment includes the Podesta e - mails — 2,060 e - mails involving , among other things , evidence that Hillary Clinton , as secretary of state , approved her part of the deal to <t> transfer control </t> of a company called “ Uranium One ” to Russian interests — along with giving Russia “ effective control of one - fifth of all uranium production capacity in the United States . ” Meanwhile , the Clinton Foundation received millions of dollars in “ donations ” from “ individuals directly connected to the deal including the Chairman of Uranium One , Ian Telfer . ” Furthermore , though Secretary Clinton was required to disclose all donors to the Clinton Foundation , the “ donations ” from Tefler were not disclosed . And , just to top it off , when the New York Times reported on this scandal last year , Clinton Campaign spokesman Brian Fallon denied the allegations in an e - mail to the Times , saying :

Clinton herself has been off the trail all Friday , deep in New York debate prep ahead of her clash with Trump on Sunday .

Often when Trump ’s past statements and actions catch up with him , Clinton ’s operatives and her surrounding groups are quick to pounce , releasing web videos , tweets , and statements . But on Friday afternoon — as cable network after cable network picked up the story , Democratic Senate candidates sought to lash their opponents to Trump , and political groups focused on women ripped into him — none came , either from Clinton ’s team or her super PAC .

Sent: The United Kingdom has been by far the biggest purchaser of US weapons in Europe of late , with more than $ 6 billion in deals struck over the past two years alone — more , that is , than the US has sold to all other European countries combined . The British defense behemoth BAE is Lockheed Martin ’s principal foreign partner on the F-35 combat aircraft , which at a projected cost of $ 1.4 trillion over its lifetime already qualifies as the most expensive weapons program in history . If Brexit - driven austerity were to lead to a delay in , or the cancellation of , the F-35 deal ( or any other major weapons <t> shipments </t> ) , it would be a blow to American arms makers . But count on one thing : Were there to be even a hint that this might happen to the F-35 , lobbyists for BAE will mobilize to get the deal privileged status , whatever other budget cuts may be in the works . On the bright side ( if you happen to be a weapons maker ) , any British reductions will certainly be more than offset by opportunities in Eastern and Central Europe , where a new Cold War seems to be gaining traction .

Top Iranian officials have admitted that sanctions relief included in the Iran deal drove them to begin talks , backing up Clinton 's claim that her push to enact sanctions brought Tehran to the nuclear negotiations . But while Clinton 's role in pushing foreign countries to adopt the tough UN sanctions is clear , it 's also evident U.S. lawmakers pushed for tough sanctions as well -- indeed , tougher sanctions than Clinton was lobbying for abroad .

Sent: The bar has now been set so low for the GOP nominee that he could do the following on stage in St. Louis and still receive passing grades : suggest that as president he would jail his opponent ; defend Vladimir Putin and Russia over the hacking of the U.S. election ; praise brutal Syrian tyrant Bashar Assad ; admit to not paying federal income tax ; and rebuke his own running mate for daring to criticize Russia over the indiscriminate bombing of Syrian civilians . That 's a very partial list . Trump also lied with enthusiastic regularity , again saying he opposed the second Iraq <t> war </t> before it started ( he did n't ) , claimed his opponent would jack up the tax rate on the middle class ( she says she wo n't ) and protested that he did not Tweet at 3 a.m. that people should check out a sex tape featuring a former Miss Universe ( he did ) . And never mind that Trump spent the first portion of the debate apologizing for a video leaked over the weekend in which he grotesquely bragged about his ability to commit sexual assault because he 's a " star . " Diving deeply into the gutter , Trump tried to turn the video into a bizarre bank shot attack on Clinton by bringing to the debate women who claim former President Bill Clinton sexually abused them .

Inside WikiLeaks , a tiny organisation with only a few hundred thousand dollars in the bank , such pressure felt immense .

The way the Clintons made their money last year translates to their high tax rate , Gale said : They are “ paying a much higher rate than , say , Mitt Romney did in 2012 or Warren Buffett does , because those people ’s income is all in the form of capital gains . ” Capital gains are generally taxed at a lower rate .

Sent: But Putin ’s comments are at odds with how the network operates in practice , according to interviews with people who closely watch or have worked at RT , and my own hours of monitoring the network and its website . One former RT staffer in Washington told me that she left her job , along with others who have also spoken to the media , after seeing the network ’s Moscow - based editors instruct journalists to make their coverage hew to the Moscow - approved political line . Such concerns erupted into full view a couple years ago when Russia marched into neighboring Ukraine to <t> annex </t> the Crimean Peninsula , leading a 28-year - old RT presenter named Liz Wahl to quit on - air , declaring , “ I can not be a part of a network funded by the Russian government that whitewashes the actions of Putin . ” Just under the surface is a bought - and - paid - for propaganda vehicle trying to nudge viewers toward Russia ’s side of the story at a time when Moscow has increasingly become an international pariah . Today , it ’s clear RT operates less as the free and independent news source Putin touted , and more as a vehicle that increasingly uses the available tools of the digital revolution — from viral videos ( “ Animated Genitals , ” “ Lawnmower Explodes ” ) to entertainingly snarky tweets — to promote Russia ’s message .

During a meeting at the Kremlin with his top generals on Nov. 10 , he accused the U.S. of trying to “ neutralize ” Russia ’s nuclear arsenal by building a missile shield over Europe , one that could knock Russian rockets out of the sky . In response , he said , Russia would have to “ strengthen the potential of its strategic nuclear forces , ” including the deployment of “ attack systems ” capable of <t> piercing </t> any missile shield . As if on cue , a state television camera then zoomed in on a piece of paper that one of the generals was holding in his hand .

In North Carolina , Republican lawmakers and staffers requested racial breakdowns of different <t> voting </t> methods , then crafted a bill that would “ target African - Americans with almost surgical precision , ” a federal judge wrote . North Carolina stood out from other states only because its Republican officials made the mistake of putting their motives in writing . The other elements — the belief , against all evidence , that Democrats benefit from pervasive fraud ; the support for measures designed to suppress minority voting — are points of party consensus .

Furthermore , if any of its clients misused its services or did anything illegal , the firm <t> professes </t> itself deeply shocked and distressed ( I am paraphrasing , but not by much ) .

It is little wonder why 50 Republican national security officials wrote an unprecedented joint letter saying that Trump “ would be the most reckless President in American history . ” 13 . Trump the misogynist The videotape heard round the world confirmed that Donald Trump ’s misogyny is even deeper and more repulsive than he had long displayed .

Fox News host Megyn Kelly asked Donald Trump a pointed question about his verbal treatment of women .

Watching honorable Republican - elected officials such as House Speaker Paul D.

In a December 2011 email to Podesta and Cheryl Mills , who was then serving as Hillary Clinton ’s chief of staff in the State Department , Band alleged that “ the stress of all of this office crap with [ Bill Clinton ] and [ Chelsea Clinton ] ” had contributed to pushing a top foundation official to the brink of suicide .

Obama himself <t> preached </t> caution at a news conference this week . Imposing penalties , he said , “ requires us to really be able to pin down and know what we ’re talking about . ” The prospect of a lengthy wait is unnerving for Clinton supporters , who see potential repeats of last month ’s mass release of Democratic National Committee emails as one of a handful of unpredictable curveballs that could still toss the White House to Donald Trump .
